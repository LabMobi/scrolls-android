/*
 * Easier ways to post logs:
 * 1) You can use the LogPostActivity (if you want the post be visible to the user).
 * Just call builder.launchActivity(context);
 *
 * 2) You can use the LogPostService (if you want to do a sneaky post on background and unnoticed). 
 * Just call builder.launchService(context);
 *
 * 3) For file logs you can use the LogListActivity and the LogReaderActivity. 
 * The first one gives you a list of available logs and the other one displays the contents. They also allow to post (they use LogPostActivity for this) and delete logs.
 * Just start the LogListActivity by giving all the parameters by intent extras and do not forget to modify the Manifest for extra components (LogListActivity, LogReaderActivity and LogPostActivity).
